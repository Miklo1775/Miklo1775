-As of July 13th, there has been what seems to be a bug on my contributions graph. It essentially is showing that i had a break in April and May and parts of June and July but in reality I had no break. I believe it may be due to a couple of changes that I did to my profile so i restored to previous settings and hoping my contributions come back. I will be in touch with support if issue is not resolved.
